# Welcome to the Chrysalis Software Page


Chrysalis has been developed at the University of Minnesota by Dmitri Kotov (kotov003@umn.edu) in Marc Jenkins' laboratory in collaboration with Thomas Pengo of the University of Minnesota University Imaging Center. 

Chrysalis processes static images (4D images), like those acquired on confocal or epifluorescent microscopes, as well as 2-photon movies (5D images) to prepare the images for further analysis in Imaris or ImageJ. 


### Features


* *Spectral Unmixing*: This feature applies linear unmixing to the image based on a user defined "compensation matrix".

* *New Channel*: This feature generates a new channel that based on properties of existing channels. For example, this feature can be used to create a new channel that only contains voxels for dendritic cells by including channels for CD11c and MHCII while excluding channels for B220, F4/80, and CD3 and using CD11c as the signal intensity for this new channel.

* *Save movie as AVI file*: This feature is great for quickly looking over movies to determine which movies have healthy tissue and are worth analyzing further.

* *Merge all images in each file*: Static images (4D images) can use this feature to combine multiple images from a single tissue into one large image, thereby allowing for simulatenous analysis.



More detailed explanations of each feature described here as well as additional features can be found in the Chrysalis documentation.docx file at the Chrysalis github site.


### How to Run Chrysalis
 
 
The compiled version of Chrysalis can be run in Windows or Mac OSX while the non-compiled code can be run and edited in Matlab. 

See the Chrysalis documentation.docx file at the Chrysalis github site for more details.
